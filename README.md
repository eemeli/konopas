KonOpas
=======

A mobile-friendly guide for conventions, with all sorts of spiffy features.

**[KonOpas]** is free, open-source software distributed under the terms of the
[ISC license](./LICENSE).


## Description

[KonOpas] is a front end for the programme of a convention, conference or any
other single- or multi-track event. It's written in JavaScript, and it works in
practically all modern browsers, including those on mobile phones. It can use
HTML5 caching to make itself available even without a live net connection, and
it remembers your item selections across sessions.

The hosting requirements for KonOpas are minimal, as all the processing is done
by the browser; all the files are served statically. Some back-end scripting may
be required if you require live updates of the programme during the event.

Built and tested for a growing number of large and small conventions and
conferences, KonOpas is about as easy to use as possible. With automatic filter
rule generation from your data, KonOpas can be set up for your event by just
adding your name and logo to an HTML file, along with pointers to your
programme and participant data.

The open-source KonOpas client can also talk with a dedicated KonOpas server.
The server enables item sync across different browsers, devices and calendar
apps; item-specific voting and commenting; and allows the event organisers to
track which items were the most popular. To enable server access for your event,
please get in touch with us at info@konopas.org.

## Getting Started

As KonOpas is a front end for your event's programme, you'll need to actually
manage your programme with a different tool. So far we've got built-in
integration with at least [Conference Planner]/[Grenadine] and [Zambia], with
more to come. For smaller events, a simple [PHP script] is available for
fetching data from a publicly readable Google Drive Spreadsheet and converting
it to the [KonOpas format][KO-fmt].

[Conference Planner]: http://sourceforge.net/projects/conferenceplan/
[Grenadine]: http://events.grenadine.co/
[Zambia]: https://github.com/olszowka/Zambia
[PHP script]: https://github.com/eemeli/konopas/tree/master/util/gdrive2js
[KO-fmt]: http://konopas.org/data-fmt


To get started, you should download the [latest release of KonOpas][KO-latest],
which includes the compiled & minified Javascript and CSS files. Alternatively,
if you clone the [repository][KO-repo], you'll have a much easier time of
making changes to the skin or hacking the Javascript source, but you'll need to
compile the code yourself---instructions for that are in the following section.

[KO-repo]: https://github.com/eemeli/konopas

In the zip file, you'll find the distribution version of KonOpas in the `dist/`
folder; this is what you'll need to deploy on your own server.

Once you've got your programme data in the [proper format][KO-fmt], you should
just change the `<script>` tags at the bottom of `index.html` to point to your
data, and open the page in a web browser. If all goes well, you should see your
programme nearly ready to use! If there are problems, the first place to look
for more information is your browser's developer console.

To start customizing KonOpas for your event, edit the HTML file by replacing
stand-in phrases like `KonOpas Sample Guide` and `CONVENTION` as appropriate.
The `title` and `title-small` images are the logo that's displayed at the top of
the page; there are two as you may wish to use a different graphic for the wide
and narrow-aspect layouts. Near the bottom of the file you'll find the KonOpas
instantiation, with optional [customizations][KO-cfg].

For more in-depth changes such as changes to the color scheme or fonts, you'll
need to edit the `skin/*.less` files and recompile them into CSS. For
internationalization and other needs, we have a few other [utilities][KO-util]
available.

The HTML5 [cache manifest] is by default not enabled, as it makes testing and
development a bit of a hassle. To enable, you should update the contents of
`konopas.appcache` to match your deployment and add a reference to it in the
`<html>` tag. Do check that your server is properly serving it with the
`text/cache-manifest` MIME type, and that the manifest doesn't include itself
(debugging a bad manifest can be tricky).

## Compilation & Dependencies

For most use cases, KonOpas should be usable directly. However, if you'd like to
change things such as the interface language, or if you'd like to just poke
under the hood in general, you'll need to recompile it.

For **styling**, KonOpas uses [LESS], which requires compilation into CSS if
modified. This should make it easier for you to tune the default skin to match
your needs. [`skin/main.less`](skin/main.less) is the place where the
colourscheme is set.

For **internationalization**, we use [messageformat.js], which is based on
[ICU MessageFormat] syntax. So far [localizations](src/i18n/) include English,
Finnish, and Swedish.

### make

To compile KonOpas for yourself, you should clone the git repo and install the
dependencies using [npm]. The following commands should get you set up:
```
git clone https://github.com/eemeli/konopas.git
cd konopas
npm install
make all
```

The `all` and `dev` make targets will build the browser-ready KonOpas in the
`dist/` subdirectory; `make precache` gzips some of the more compressible output
files for use on servers that where a config
[like this](util/apache-enable-gzip.conf) is in use. If you've [Watchman]
installed, `make watch` will start it with triggers for automatically updating
the JS & CSS files during development.

To change the default (English) locale of KonOpas, use the `LC` variable:
```
LC=en,fi make all
```
Once set, the same locale will be used until reset as above or by `make clean`.
